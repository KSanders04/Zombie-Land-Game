# Zombie Land

## Description:
Zombie Land is a fast-paced top-down shooter where this game depends on precision, positioning, and quick reflexes. You are dropped into a zombie-infested map with the objective to eliminate as many zombies as possible.

Move around using WASD, aim with your mouse, and right click on mouse to fire. Manage your ammo carefully and press R to reload. Zombies deal damage on contact, and with only 100 health, poor movement or slow reactions can end a run quickly.

The game emphasizes constant movement, accurate aiming, and smart decision-making as the zombie count ramps up, pushing players to survive longer and improve their score each run.

## Instructions:

- Use keys WASD to move around
- Use a mouse to aim and shoot at zombies
- Use the R key to reload weapon
- You have 100 health
- Shoot as many zombies as you can
